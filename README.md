rest_client_ios
===============

Rest client / shopping app for iOS written in Swift

Basic functions - products list, product details, login, register, user account, logout, cart, payment. Products list has a core data caching layer.
 
 Note: I did this while learning iOS and Swift, I think it has an overall nice structure but there are parts which certainly can be improved. Also, after the update to compile with Swift 1.1, I haven't tested more than starting it.
